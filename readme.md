# Turtle experiment with fun math

A Python project that generates various colorful, dynamic geometric patterns and natural forms using Turtle graphics and custom color palettes.
It is made for my amusement and i usually add to it on long train rides ðŸ˜ŒâœŒðŸ’–
## Usage

just run the cells, there is one for every function with a very brief description for each, there are a lot of parameters that can be tuned

## Cute generation examples
